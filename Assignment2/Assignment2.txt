1. find /etc -type f > one.txt 2> two.txt
a. The above command file all the files in /etc directory and list the output in one.txt file and errors in two.txt
find /etc -type f       // find all the files in /etc directory
>                       // Standard output
> one.txt               // list all the files found in /etc directory
2>                      // Standard Error
2> two.txt              // If any error occurs during the search, list the errors in two.txt file
b. one.txt file has all the files found in /etc directory.
   two.txt file has all the errors occur during the search.


2. As per the Dataset, the Top 3 [Month, Year] with the most number of YouTube channels created were :
March,2006 with 15 channels
July,2014 with 13 channels
August,2014 with 12 channels

The command:
sort -t',' -k20 -k21M Global\ YouTube\ Statistics.csv | cut -d ',' -f 20,21 | uniq -c | sort -nr
sort -t',' -k20 -k21M Global\ YouTube\ Statistics.csv   // sort by the year and month
cut -d ',' -f 20,21                                     // get the year and month column
uniq -c                                                 // show the count of the year,month
sort -nr                                                // sort the result so it's easier to find the most number


3. ps -u maysp24 shows all the processes owned by me.
[maysp24@sjsu cs131]$ ps -u maysp24
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
3311255 ?        00:00:02 systemd
3311257 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
3311264 ?        00:00:00 sshd
3311265 pts/1    00:00:00 bash

3314312 pts/4    00:00:00 bash
3330363 pts/1    00:00:00 ps



4.b. When the file.txt is open in another terminal using vi command â€¦
[maysp24@sjsu cs131]$ ps -u maysp24
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
3311255 ?        00:00:02 systemd
3311257 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
3311264 ?        00:00:00 sshd
3311265 pts/1    00:00:00 bash
3314311 ?        00:00:00 sshd
3314312 pts/4    00:00:00 bash
*** 3330868 pts/4    00:00:00 vim ***
3330884 pts/1    00:00:00 ps


d. When the file.txt is closed in another terminal, there is no PID for vim because vim has been terminated. 
[maysp24@sjsu cs131]$ ps -u maysp24
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
3311255 ?        00:00:02 systemd
3311257 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
3311264 ?        00:00:00 sshd
3311265 pts/1    00:00:00 bash
3314311 ?        00:00:00 sshd
3314312 pts/4    00:00:00 bash
3331572 pts/1    00:00:00 ps


5. The init is the first process that the kernel executes in Linux. It has a process ID (PID) of 1 and is responsible for initializing the system.
The output for this command pgrep systemd is:
1
2951
2998
3746
86087
105881
2060795
2073814

2808486
3304023
3311255
3312757
3316769
3854249
The numbers are the PIDs of all the processes that have systemd in their name or command.


6. In Linux, the command ps aux displays the details of all the running processes, including those run by the other users.
The output includes information about the USER, process ID (PID), CPU and Memory usage (CPU % and MEM %), and the executed command.
